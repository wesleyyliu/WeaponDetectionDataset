Dataset pulled from https://github.com/Deepknowledge-US/US-Real-time-gun-detection-in-CCTV-An-open-problem-dataset/tree/gh-pages

XML annotations have classes changed according to my weapon detection model using the script. 
Script also separates XML annotations and jpgs into two different folders (original dataset was all in one folder). 
It also gets around 10% of the dataset randomly.
